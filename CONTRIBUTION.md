# Solid Helm Charts â€” contribution guide

## Pre-commit hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run some checks before committing and automatically generate documentation.

To install the pre-commit hooks, run:

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Tasks

For some automation the project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) - modern task runner, a cross-platform build tool inspired by Make.
