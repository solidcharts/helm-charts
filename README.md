# Solid Helm Charts

## Mission

Set of helm charts which use official images from given tool providers. This repository has been created as a Bitnami charts alternative, due to the paywall
introduced for Bitnami images.

The second problem with Bitnami charts was that they are using custom images and quite often different environment variables and configurations than the official
tools. It's quite hard to use them official image with the provided helm charts.

These charts will always be free and open source. Feel free to contribute or copy repo and use them internally.

## Charts

For the tools that have official helm charts, we recommend them, and instead of chart we just provide README.md with a link to the official chart.
