# Solid Helm Charts

## Mission

Set of helm charts which use official images from given tool providers.

This repository has been created due to a couple of reasons:

- as a Bitnami charts alternative, due to the paywall introduced for Bitnami images
- charts are using official open-source tools images, so there are no issues with configuration settings and environment variables (often issue with Bitnami
  charts)
- these charts are hosted on GitHub, so no rate limits issues ðŸ™‚

**These charts will always be free and open source.** Feel free to contribute or copy repo and use them internally.

## Charts

For the tools that have official helm charts, we recommend them, and instead of chart we just provide README.md with a link to the official chart.
